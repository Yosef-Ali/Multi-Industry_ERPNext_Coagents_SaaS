# Feature Specification: ERPNext Coagents SaaS (Multi-Industry Platform)

**Feature Branch**: `001-erpnext-coagents-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Multi-industry ERPNext coagent assistance system with safe automation and SaaS app generation. Initial implementations for Hotel and Hospital verticals, with extensible architecture for additional industries.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: FR-010 - How should operations be classified as low-risk vs high-risk for approval prompts? ‚Üí A: Hybrid approach combining field sensitivity (text/note vs financial/status), document state (draft vs submitted), and operation scope (single vs bulk), with configurable thresholds
- Q: FR-055 - Do performance SLAs include or exclude ERPNext API latency? ‚Üí A: End-to-end measurement (user request ‚Üí ERPNext API ‚Üí response streaming). System owns full latency.
- Q: FR-029 - What artifacts should app generation produce? ‚Üí A: DocType JSON schemas + agent tool handler stubs (create, read, update functions) registered with coagent SDK
- Q: FR-042 - Where should logs be stored and for how long? ‚Üí A: File-based logs with automatic rotation. Retention disk-space dependent, recommended minimum 30 days.
- Q: Scale assumptions - What are concurrent user expectations for MVP? ‚Üí A: Small team scale (5-20 concurrent users per installation, single-server deployment sufficient)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Hospitality (Hotel) Scenario**: A front desk agent is processing a walk-in guest requesting a room. They open the Reservation form in ERPNext and click a "Copilot" button that appears on the form. A side panel opens where they can chat with an AI assistant. They ask "What rooms are available tonight for 2 guests?" The assistant proposes to search available rooms and shows what it plans to do. The agent clicks "Approve" and sees results stream in real-time showing available room options with pricing.

**Healthcare (Hospital) Scenario**: A doctor is documenting a patient encounter and needs to create a standard order set (labs + medications). Instead of manually creating multiple orders, they ask the copilot "Create sepsis protocol orders". The assistant shows a preview of the orders it will create (CBC, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics with dosing). The clinician reviews and clicks "Approve", and the system creates all linked documents in ERPNext.

**Manufacturing Scenario**: A production planner opens a Work Order form and asks the copilot "Check material availability for this production run". The assistant searches inventory across warehouses, identifies shortages, and displays results with recommendations. When the planner asks to "Create purchase requisitions for missing materials", the assistant shows a preview of requisitions to be created with quantities and preferred suppliers, awaiting approval.

**Retail Scenario**: A store manager viewing a Sales Order asks the copilot "What's the delivery status and estimated arrival?" The assistant queries linked delivery notes, shipping integrations, and displays tracking information. When the manager says "Send update to customer", the assistant drafts a communication preview for approval before sending.

**Education Scenario**: An admissions officer on a Student Applicant form asks "Schedule interviews for shortlisted candidates this week". The assistant checks interviewer availability, proposes time slots, and shows a preview of calendar events and email notifications to be created, requiring approval before execution.

**Admin SaaS Generation Scenario**: An administrator from any industry wants to add a custom module to their ERPNext instance. They provide a brief description (e.g., "Telemedicine Visit module" for healthcare, "Equipment Maintenance Tracker" for manufacturing, "Member Loyalty Program" for retail). The system analyzes the request and generates a proposed app structure showing new document types, fields, and workflows. The admin reviews the plan, approves it, and the system generates the custom ERPNext app skeleton ready for refinement.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is viewing a Reservation form in ERPNext hotel module, **When** they click the Copilot button, **Then** a side panel opens with a chat interface and the assistant greets them with context about the current reservation

2. **Given** a clinician types a request to create clinical orders, **When** the assistant determines this requires data changes, **Then** the assistant displays an approval prompt showing exactly what will be created before executing any actions

3. **Given** a front desk agent requests availability data, **When** the assistant retrieves room information, **Then** results stream into the chat panel incrementally without requiring approval (read-only operation)

4. **Given** an admin submits an app generation request, **When** the system creates an app plan, **Then** the plan shows proposed document types, fields, relationships, and workflow steps in a reviewable format requiring explicit approval before generation begins

5. **Given** a billing user requests a financial report (ADR/RevPAR for hotel or A/R by payer for hospital), **When** the assistant runs the report, **Then** results display in a formatted table with export options

6. **Given** a user's ERPNext role lacks permission for a requested operation, **When** the assistant attempts the action via API, **Then** the system denies the operation and explains the permission requirement to the user

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user approves an action but the ERPNext API call fails (network timeout, validation error)? System should show clear error message and allow retry without re-approval
- How does the system handle concurrent modifications (user approves room reservation but room becomes booked by another user before execution)? System should detect conflict and notify user
- What happens when a multi-step workflow is interrupted mid-execution (browser closed, session expired)? System should maintain state and allow resumption or rollback
- How does the assistant handle ambiguous requests (user asks "create order" without specifying what kind)? System should ask clarifying questions before proposing actions
- What happens when app generation is approved but encounters errors during skeleton creation? System should report partial progress and allow continuation or rollback
