# 🎉 Backend Integration Complete

## ✅ Chat → Backend → ERPNext Flow Connected

Your CopilotKit chat interface is now connected to the LangGraph workflow service!

---

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. **Workflow Service Client** (`lib/workflow-client.ts`)
- TypeScript client for workflow API
- Executes workflows via POST `/execute`
- Lists workflows via GET `/workflows`
- Supports streaming and non-streaming modes

### 2. **CopilotKit Actions** (`src/components/ERPNextActions.tsx`)
- **hotel_check_in_guest** - Check in guests to hotel rooms
- **create_sales_order** - Create retail sales orders with fulfillment
- **list_available_workflows** - Discover available workflows by industry

### 3. **Updated Chat UI** (`app/page.tsx`)
- Connected to workflow service
- Example prompts for testing
- Status indicator showing backend connection

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Workflow Service (Local)
```bash
cd services/workflows
python src/server.py
```

**Service will run on:** `http://localhost:8001`

### Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend/coagent
npm run dev
```

**App will run on:** `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 💬 Test the Chat

Open http://localhost:3000 and try these prompts:

### Hotel Check-In
```
Check in John Doe to room 101 from 2024-10-10 to 2024-10-15 with reservation RES-001
```

**What happens:**
1. AI extracts parameters from your message
2. Calls `hotel_check_in_guest` action
3. Sends POST to `http://localhost:8001/execute`
4. Executes `hotel_o2c` workflow
5. Returns result to chat

### Create Sales Order
```
Create a sales order for customer CUST-001 named Jane Smith with item ITEM-001 qty 5, deliver on 2024-10-15 from Main Warehouse
```

**What happens:**
1. AI extracts customer, items, dates
2. Calls `create_sales_order` action
3. Executes `retail_fulfillment` workflow
4. Creates sales order in ERPNext (simulated)

### List Workflows
```
Show me all available hotel workflows
```

**Returns:**
- hotel_o2c workflow details
- Description and parameters

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working
- ✅ Workflow service running locally (http://localhost:8001)
- ✅ 5 workflows available (hotel, hospital, manufacturing, retail, education)
- ✅ CopilotKit actions registered
- ✅ Frontend → Backend connection established
- ✅ TypeScript integration complete

### ⏳ Next Steps
1. **Deploy workflow service to Render** (free tier)
2. **Update production URL** in components
3. **Add more workflow actions** (hospital admissions, manufacturing, etc.)
4. **Connect to real ERPNext instance** (currently using mock data)
5. **Add approval flow UI** for interrupted workflows

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to execute workflow"
**Check:** Is workflow service running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/
# Should return: {"service": "ERPNext Workflow Service", "status": "healthy"}
```

### "Action not found"
**Check:** Is ERPNextActions component imported in page.tsx?
```tsx
import { ERPNextActions } from "../src/components/ERPNextActions";

<ERPNextActions />
```

### CORS errors
**Fix:** Workflow service already has CORS enabled for all origins
