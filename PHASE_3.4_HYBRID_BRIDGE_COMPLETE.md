# Phase 3.4: Hybrid Workflow Bridge - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: All tasks completed (T168-T170)

## Summary

Successfully implemented the critical hybrid architecture bridge that connects the Claude Agent SDK intelligence layer with LangGraph deterministic workflow layer. This solves the `execute_workflow` problem where the same tool name must support different workflow logic per industry.

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Two-Layer Design

```
Layer 1: Claude Agent SDK (Intelligence)
    ↓
    Industry Subagents invoke execute_workflow_graph tool
    ↓
Layer 2: LangGraph (Deterministic State Machines)
    ↓
    Workflow executes with approval gates and streaming
    ↓
    Progress events stream back to AG-UI via SSE
```

### Problem Solved

**Before**: Single `execute_workflow` tool trying to handle different logic per industry
- Hotel: 4-step O2C workflow (check-in → folio → check-out → invoice)
- Hospital: 6-step admissions workflow (patient → orders → encounter → billing)
- Different approval gates, state transitions, retry strategies

**After**: Hybrid bridge architecture
- Industry subagents invoke `execute_workflow_graph` with graph name
- Workflow registry maps graph name → Python LangGraph module
- LangGraph executes deterministic state machine
- Progress streams back through AG-UI

## Completed Tasks

### T168: Workflow Bridge Tool ✅

**File**: `services/agent-gateway/src/tools/workflow/executor.ts`

**Features**:
- `executeWorkflowGraph()` - Main bridge function
- `WORKFLOW_REGISTRY` - Maps 15 workflow graphs to modules
- HTTP client to Python workflow service
- Mock execution for development/testing
- Streaming support with progress events
- Tool definition for Claude Agent SDK

**Workflow Registry Includes**:
- **Hotel**: hotel_o2c, hotel_cancellation, hotel_group_booking
- **Hospital**: hospital_admissions, hospital_discharge, order_fulfillment
- **Manufacturing**: manufacturing_mto, manufacturing_completion
- **Retail**: retail_order_fulfillment, retail_replenishment, retail_returns
- **Education**: education_admissions, education_enrollment, interview_scheduling

**Event Types**:
- `workflow_start` - Workflow execution begins
- `step_start` - Individual step starts
- `step_complete` - Step finished successfully
- `approval_required` - Waiting for user approval
- `workflow_complete` - All steps completed
- `workflow_error` - Execution failed

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
import { executeWorkflowGraph } from "./tools/workflow/executor.js";

const result = await executeWorkflowGraph(
  {
    graph_name: "hotel_o2c",
    initial_state: {
      reservation_id: "RES-001",
      guest_name: "John Doe",
      room_number: "101",
      check_in_date: "2025-10-01",
      check_out_date: "2025-10-02"
    }
  },
  (event) => {
    // Stream progress to AG-UI
    console.log(`Step ${event.step}: ${event.progress?.percentage}%`);

    "guest_name": "John Doe",
    # ... other fields
})

if valid:
    # Load and execute

   - Compatible with HTTP streaming responses

**Example Usage**:
```python
from workflows.core.stream_adapter import execute_workflow_with_streaming

async def emit_to_frontend(event):
    # Send SSE event to HTTP response
    response.write(f"event: {event.type}\ndata: {json.dumps(event.data)}\n\n")

result = await execute_workflow_with_streaming(
    graph_name="hotel_o2c",
    initial_state={"reservation_id": "RES-001"},
    emit_fn=emit_to_frontend
)
```

## Integration Flow

### Complete Request-to-Response Flow

```
1. User Request: "Check in John Doe and create invoice"
   ↓
2. Orchestrator: classify_request()
   → Classification: industry=hotel, complexity=multi_step, routing=delegate
   ↓
3. Orchestrator: invoke_subagent("hotel-specialist")
   ↓
4. Hotel Subagent: Decides to use execute_workflow_graph
   ↓
5. TypeScript Bridge (executor.ts):
   → Validates graph_name="hotel_o2c"
   → Calls Python workflow service HTTP endpoint
   ↓
6. Python Workflow Service:
   → Registry loads hotel.o2c_graph module
   → Compiles StateGraph
   ↓
7. LangGraph Execution:
   → Step 1: check_in_guest (approval required)
   → Step 2: create_folio
   → Step 3: add_charges
   → Step 4: check_out_guest
   → Step 5: generate_invoice (approval required)
   ↓
8. Stream Adapter (stream_adapter.py):
   → Monitors each state transition
   → Emits WorkflowProgressEvent for each step
   ↓
9. SSE Stream to Frontend:
   → event: workflow_progress
   → data: {"type": "step_complete", "step": "check_in_guest", "progress": {"percentage": 20}}
   ↓
10. AG-UI Frontend:
    → Displays progress bar
    → Shows approval dialogs
    → Updates in real-time
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Two-Language Architecture
- **TypeScript** (Claude Agent SDK layer): Intelligence, routing, tool calling
- **Python** (LangGraph layer): Deterministic workflows, state machines
- **Bridge**: HTTP API + streaming adapter

**Rationale**:
- Claude Agent SDK is TypeScript/JavaScript
- LangGraph is Python
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. Dynamic Module Loading
- Registry uses `importlib` for dynamic graph loading
- No hardcoded imports
- Easy to add new workflows without modifying registry

### 3. Streaming Architecture
- Real-time progress updates to frontend
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for HTTP streaming
- Event-driven with WorkflowProgressEvent

### 4. State Validation
- Registry validates initial state against schema
- Prevents runtime errors from missing fields
- Clear error messages for debugging
