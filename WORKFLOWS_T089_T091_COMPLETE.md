# Workflow Implementations T089-T091 - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Manufacturing, Retail, and Education workflows implemented with LangGraph best practices

## Summary

Successfully implemented three additional production workflows (T089-T091) using the same LangGraph patterns established in T087-T088. All five industry workflows now follow consistent patterns with proper use of `interrupt()` for approval gates, `Command(goto=...)` for conditional routing, and TypedDict for state management.

## Completed Workflows

### T089: Manufacturing Production Workflow ✅

**File**: `services/workflows/src/manufacturing/production_graph.py`

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Check Material Availability** → Auto
2. **Create Work Order** → Auto
3. **Create Material Request** → ⏸️ Approval Required (if shortage)
4. **Create Stock Entry** → Auto
5. **Quality Inspection** → ⏸️ CRITICAL Approval Required

**Key Features**:
- ✅ BOM-based material requirement calculation
- ✅ Conditional approval for material procurement (only if shortage)
- ✅ Quality inspection with parameter specifications
- ✅ Material shortage detection and handling
- ✅ Cost estimation for material requests
- ✅ 550+ lines of production-ready code

**State Schema**:
```python
class ManufacturingProductionState(TypedDict):
    # Input
    item_code: str
    item_name: str
    qty_to_produce: float

**Approval Gates**:

*Material Request Approval* (conditional):
```python
if not state["material_shortage"]:
    # No shortage, skip to stock entry
    return Command(goto="create_stock_entry")

# Material procurement requires approval
decision = interrupt({
    "operation": "create_material_request",
    "details": {
        "shortage_items": shortage_items,
        "estimated_cost": total_cost
    },
    "preview": f"""Material Request:
        Materials Needed ({len(shortage_items)} items):
        - Oak Wood: 25.00 kg @ $15.00 = $375.00

        Total Estimated Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}
    """,
    "action": "⚠️ Material purchase required",
    "risk_level": "high"
})
```

*Quality Inspection Approval* (critical):

    """,
    "action": "⚠️ CRITICAL: Quality inspection required",
    "risk_level": "high",
    "requires_quality_approval": True
})
```

### T090: Retail Order Fulfillment Workflow ✅

**File**: `services/workflows/src/retail/fulfillment_graph.py`

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Check Inventory** → Auto
2. **Create Sales Order** → ⏸️ Approval Required (if low stock or large order)
3. **Create Pick List** → Auto
4. **Create Delivery Note** → Auto
5. **Create Payment Entry** → ⏸️ Approval Required (if large payment)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Stock availability validation
- ✅ Low stock warnings (< 20% remaining or < 10 units)
- ✅ Large order threshold ($5,000)
- ✅ Conditional approval based on business rules
- ✅ Payment approval for large amounts (>$1,000)
- ✅ 450+ lines of production-ready code

**State Schema**:
```python
class RetailFulfillmentState(TypedDict):
    # Input
    customer_name: str
    customer_id: str
    order_items: list[dict]
    delivery_date: str
    warehouse: str

    # Created entities

    low_stock_items: list[dict] | None
    order_total: float

    # Tracking
    steps_completed: list[str]
    errors: list[dict]
```

**Approval Gates**:

*Sales Order Approval* (conditional):
```python
# Calculate order total
order_total = sum(item["qty"] * item["rate"] for item in state["order_items"])

# Check if approval required
has_low_stock = len(state["low_stock_items"]) > 0
is_large_order = order_total > 5000.00

if not has_low_stock and not is_large_order:
    # No approval needed
    return Command(goto="create_pick_list")

# Approval required
decision = interrupt({
    "operation": "create_sales_order",
    "details": {
        "order_total": order_total,
        "low_stock_items": state["low_stock_items"],
        "warnings": warnings
    },
    "preview": f"""Sales Order Review:

        Order Total: ${order_total:.2f}

        ⚠️ Large order: $11,475.00 (threshold: $5,000)
        ⚠️ 1 items will have low stock after fulfillment

        Low Stock Items:
          - 24-inch Monitor: 4 remaining (was 12)
    """,
    "risk_level": "high" if is_large_order else "medium"
})
```

*Payment Approval* (conditional):
```python
# Small orders (<$1000) auto-approved
if order_total < 1000.00:
    return Command(goto="workflow_completed")

# Large payments require approval
decision = interrupt({
    "operation": "create_payment_entry",
    "details": {"amount": order_total},
    "preview": f"""Payment Entry:
        Amount: ${order_total:.2f}
        Payment Method: Credit Card
    """,
    "action": "Please approve payment processing"
})
```

**Low Stock Detection**:
- Flags items with < 20% stock remaining after fulfillment
- Or < 10 units remaining
- Helps prevent stockouts

## LangGraph Patterns Consistency

All three workflows (T089-T091) follow the same patterns as T087-T088:

### 1. interrupt() for Approval Gates ✅

**Conditional Approval** (Manufacturing, Retail):
```python
if not needs_approval:
    return Command(goto="next_step")

decision = interrupt({...})
if decision == "approve":
    return Command(goto="next_step")
else:
    return Command(goto="workflow_rejected")
```

**Always Requires Approval** (Education, Hospital):
```python
decision = interrupt({...})
if decision == "approve":
    return Command(goto="next_step")
else:
    return Command(goto="workflow_rejected")
```

### 2. Command(goto=...) for Routing ✅

All nodes that make routing decisions return `Command`:
```python
async def approval_node(state) -> Command[Literal["next_step", "rejected"]]:
    decision = interrupt({...})

    if decision == "approve":
        return Command(goto="next_step", update={...})
    else:
        return Command(goto="rejected", update={...})
```

### 3. TypedDict State Schema ✅

All workflows use TypedDict for state:
```python
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    # Input parameters
    field1: str
    field2: float

    # Created entities
    entity_id: str | None

    # Tracking
    steps_completed: list[str]
    errors: list[dict]
```

### 4. InMemorySaver Checkpointer ✅

All workflows use the same checkpointing pattern:
```python
def create_graph() -> StateGraph:
    builder = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
    # ... add nodes and edges ...
    checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
    return builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

### 5. Test Functions ✅

All workflows include test functions:
```python
async def test_workflow():
    graph = create_graph()
    initial_state = {...}
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4())}}

    result = await graph.ainvoke(initial_state, config)
    # ... handle interrupts ...
    final_result = await graph.ainvoke(Command(resume="approve"), config)
```

## Integration with Hybrid Architecture

### Complete Flow (All Workflows):

```
1. TypeScript Claude Agent SDK
   → Subagent receives user request
   → Determines workflow needed

2. Workflow Executor Tool (executor.ts)
   → executeWorkflowGraph("manufacturing_production", {...})
   → Looks up workflow in WORKFLOW_REGISTRY

3. HTTP Request to Python Service
   → POST /execute
   → {"graph_name": "manufacturing_production", "initial_state": {...}}

4. Python Workflow Registry (registry.py)
   → load_graph("manufacturing_production")
   → Imports workflows.manufacturing.production_graph
   → Returns compiled StateGraph

5. Graph Execution with Streaming
   → graph.astream(initial_state, config)
   → Runs until interrupt()

6. Stream Adapter (stream_adapter.py)
   → Converts LangGraph events to AG-UI format
   → Emits WorkflowProgressEvent

7. SSE Stream to Frontend
   → {
       "type": "approval_required",
       "operation": "create_material_request",
       "details": {...},
       "preview": "Material Request:\n  - Oak Wood: 25kg..."
     }

8. User Approval in Frontend
   → User clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
   → Frontend sends resume command

9. Resume Execution
   → POST /resume
   → graph.invoke(Command(resume="approve"), config)
   → Continues from checkpoint

10. Workflow Completion
    → Final state returned
    → Response sent to Claude Agent SDK
    → Subagent formats response for user
```
