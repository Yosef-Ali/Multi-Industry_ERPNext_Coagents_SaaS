**Why:** Detailed how-to (but assumed too much missing!)  
**Contains:**
- Phase-by-phase plans

## ✅ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (No Action Needed!)

### 1. **Artifact System** ✅ WORKING
- Already integrated in `/developer` route
- Code artifacts render with syntax highlighting
- Preview artifacts show live HTML/React
- Side panel automatically appears
- Copy/export buttons working

**Evidence:**
```tsx
// app/developer/page.tsx uses <Chat>
// components/chat.tsx includes <Artifact> (line 210)
// Works out of the box!
```

### 2. **Message Actions** ✅ WORKING
- Copy to clipboard
- Edit previous messages
- Upvote/downvote responses
- Actions appear on hover
- Toast notifications

**Evidence:**
```tsx
// components/message-actions.tsx (186 lines)
// Fully implemented and working
```

### 3. **Suggested Actions** ✅ EXISTS
- Component fully built
- Animations working
- Grid layout responsive
- Shows on empty conversation

**Evidence:**
```tsx
// components/suggested-actions.tsx (59 lines)
// Just needs ERPNext-specific text!
```

### 4. **Conversation History** ✅ WORKING
- Sidebar shows all conversations
- Search functionality
- Delete conversations
- Auto-generated titles
- Sidebar toggle

**Evidence:**
```tsx
// app/developer/page.tsx
// <AppSidebar> already enabled!
```

### 5. **Rich Message Rendering** ✅ WORKING
- Messages display properly
- Greeting on empty state
- Thinking indicator
- Auto-scroll
- Scroll-to-bottom button

**Evidence:**
```tsx
// components/messages.tsx (130 lines)
// components/message.tsx
// All working!
```
