## 🔍 Key Findings

### Good News ✅
1. **Artifact components already built** - Just need to wire them up!
2. **Basic chat works well** - Foundation is solid
3. **CopilotKit integrated** - Don't need to rebuild
4. **Architecture sound** - Can build on what exists

### Missing Pieces ⚠️
1. **Artifact panel not integrated** - Components exist in `components/artifacts/` but not connected to `/developer`
2. **No message-level actions** - Can't copy, edit, or delete messages
3. **No suggested prompts** - Empty state not helpful
4. **Basic streaming** - Could show more status/progress

### Quick Wins 🍎
**Can implement in ~90 minutes:**
1. Enable artifact panel (30 min)
2. Add copy button (15 min)
3. Add suggested prompts (30 min)
4. Better streaming message (15 min)
