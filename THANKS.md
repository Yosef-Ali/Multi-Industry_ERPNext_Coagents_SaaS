## 🎯 Key Features Delivered

### **1. Context-Aware AI Chatbot** 🤖

Every generated ERPNext app has an AI assistant that:
- ✅ Understands current page (dashboard, students, patients, etc.)
- ✅ Knows page data (student IDs, attendance stats, alerts)
- ✅ Remembers chat history automatically
- ✅ Tracks recent user actions
- ✅ Provides intelligent responses based on context

### **2. Active Recommendation Cards** 💡

Smart suggestions appear above chat input:
- ✅ Dynamic based on current page
- ✅ Priority indicators (low/medium/high)
- ✅ One-click execution
- ✅ Context-aware (e.g., "Add Student" only on students page)
- ✅ Alert-driven (e.g., "Check Low Attendance" when alert present)

### **3. Natural Language Commands** 💬

Users can accomplish tasks through conversation:
```
User: "Enroll John Doe in 5th grade"
AI: "I'll help! What's his DOB, parent name, and contact?"
User: "2015-03-15, Mary Doe, mary@email.com"
AI: "✅ Student John Doe enrolled successfully! ID: STU-456"
```

### **4. ERPNext API Integration** 🔗

Pre-built actions for common tasks:
- `enroll_student` - Add new student
- `mark_attendance` - Record attendance
- `register_patient` - Add new patient
- `schedule_appointment` - Book appointment
- `generate_report` - Create reports
- `search_records` - Search DocTypes
- `create_doctype_record` - Generic create
- ...and more!
