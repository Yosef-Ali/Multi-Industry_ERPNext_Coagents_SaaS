## 🔍 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

When you send a message:

1. **Frontend** (localhost:3001) receives your message
2. **CopilotKit** analyzes and calls the appropriate action
3. **Action handler** sends request to workflow service (localhost:8001)
4. **Workflow service** executes LangGraph workflow
5. **Response** flows back to chat

**Full stack working locally!** ✅
