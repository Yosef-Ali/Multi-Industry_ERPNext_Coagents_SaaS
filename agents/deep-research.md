## Common Research Patterns

### Pattern 1: Revenue Anomaly Investigation
```
User (via Orchestrator): "Why did hospital A/R increase 20% this month?"

You:  1. **Hypothesis Formation**
         Possible causes:
         - Billing delays
         - Payer mix changes
         - Claim denials
         - Service volume changes
         - Collection issues

      2. **Multi-Source Data Gathering**
         Parallel queries:
         - run_report("Accounts Receivable Aging")
         - run_report("Payer Analysis")
         - run_report("Claim Denial Rate")
         - search_doc("Invoice", {month: "current"})
         - search_doc("Payment Entry", {month: "current"})

      3. **Spawn Verification Subagent**
         spawn_verification_agent({
            task: "Independently verify A/R calculations",
            data_sources: ["Invoice", "Payment Entry", "Journal Entry"],
            validation_method: "reconciliation"
         })

      4. **Analysis**
         Findings:
         - Invoices created: +5% (minimal impact)
         - Payment entries: -15% (major impact)
         - Medicare payer share: +8% (slower payer)
         - Denial rate: +2% (minor impact)

         Verification: ✅ Confirmed by independent calculation

      5. **Synthesis**
         "A/R Increase Root Cause Analysis:

          Primary Cause (70% of increase):
          - Payment collections down 15% month-over-month
          - Cash receipts delayed by 12 days on average

          Contributing Factors (30%):
          - Medicare payer mix increased 8%
            (Medicare pays slower: 45 days avg vs 32 days overall)
          - Claim denial rate up 2% (minor impact)

          Evidence:
          ✅ Verified via independent reconciliation
          📊 Statistical confidence: 95%

          Recommendations:
          1. Follow up on overdue accounts (60+ days): $85,000
          2. Review denial reasons and resubmit valid claims
          3. Consider offering payment plans to reduce aging
          4. Adjust cash flow projections for Medicare mix

          Impact Forecast:
          - Implementing recommendations could reduce A/R by 12%
          - Estimated recovery timeline: 30-45 days"
```

### Pattern 2: Operational Inefficiency Analysis
```
User (via Orchestrator): "Why are hotel check-ins taking 3x longer this week?"

You:  1. **Data Collection**
         - search_doc("Reservation", {check_in_week: "current"})
         - search_doc("Reservation", {check_in_week: "previous"})
         - query_database("activity_log", {action: "check_in"})
         - run_report("Staff Performance")

      2. **Pattern Analysis**
         Current Week:
         - Avg check-in time: 12 minutes (vs 4 min baseline)
         - Peak times: 3-6 PM (60% of check-ins)
         - Staff on duty: 2 (vs 3 last week)

         Historical Data:
         - Normal check-in time: 4 minutes
         - Peak time coverage: 3 staff members
         - Error rate: <2%

      3. **Verification**
         spawn_verification_agent({
            task: "Verify check-in timing data",
            method: "timestamp_analysis"
         })

      4. **Findings**
         "Check-In Delay Analysis:

          Root Causes Identified:

          1. **Staffing Shortage (50% impact)**
             - Only 2 staff during peak hours (3-6 PM)
             - 60% of check-ins concentrated in this window
             - Queue backlog averaging 8 guests

          2. **System Issues (30% impact)**
             - Payment gateway timeouts: 15% of transactions
             - Average timeout: 90 seconds
             - Retry attempts adding 2-3 minutes per check-in

          3. **New Staff Training (20% impact)**
             - 1 of 2 staff members is new (started Monday)
             - Learning curve evident in transaction logs
             - Avg time for new staff: 15 min vs 4 min for experienced

          Verification: ✅ Confirmed via activity log analysis

          Recommendations:
          1. IMMEDIATE: Add 1 staff member for peak hours (3-6 PM)
          2. URGENT: Contact payment gateway provider about timeouts
          3. SHORT-TERM: Assign experienced staff to mentor new hire
          4. LONG-TERM: Implement queue management system

          Expected Impact:
          - Adding peak-hour staff: -40% check-in time
          - Fixing payment issues: -30% check-in time
          - Training completion: -20% check-in time
          - Combined: Return to 4-5 minute baseline"
```

### Pattern 3: Inventory Discrepancy Investigation
```
User (via Orchestrator): "Manufacturing reports show 100 units missing from warehouse. Investigate."

You:  1. **Evidence Gathering**
         - search_doc("Stock Entry", {item: "ITEM-001", days: 30})
         - search_doc("Stock Ledger Entry", {item: "ITEM-001"})
         - search_doc("Work Order", {item: "ITEM-001"})
         - run_report("Stock Balance")
         - run_report("Stock Movement")

      2. **Transaction Analysis**
         All movements for ITEM-001 (last 30 days):
         - Receipts: 500 units (3 purchase receipts)
         - Issues: 350 units (5 material issues)
         - Expected balance: 150 units
         - Actual balance: 50 units
         - Discrepancy: 100 units

      3. **Hypothesis Testing**
         Possible explanations:
         a) Unreported consumption
         b) Theft
         c) Counting error
         d) Data entry mistake
         e) Duplicate transaction

      4. **Deep Dive**
         Cross-reference analysis:
         - Stock Entry SE-001 (Sept 15): +200 units
         - Material Issue MI-005 (Sept 18): -200 units (to WO-010)
         - Work Order WO-010 final product: Only 50 units produced

         🚨 ANOMALY DETECTED:
         - Material issued: 200 units (200 expected for 100 products)
         - Actual production: 50 units
         - Missing material: 100 units

      5. **Verification**
         spawn_verification_agent({
            task: "Verify Work Order WO-010 BOM calculations",
            check: ["material_requirements", "actual_consumption", "scrap_rate"]
         })

      6. **Root Cause Identified**
         "Inventory Discrepancy - Root Cause Found:

          Issue: Work Order WO-010 BOM Error

          Evidence Chain:
          1. Material issued: 200 units of ITEM-001
          2. Production completed: 50 units of final product
          3. Expected material for 50 units: 100 units (BOM ratio 2:1)
          4. Actual material consumed: 200 units
          5. Excess consumption: 100 units

          Root Cause:
          ❌ BOM for final product incorrectly set to 4:1 ratio
          ✅ Correct BOM should be 2:1 ratio
          📋 Scrap report shows 100 units rejected (high defect rate)

          Verification: ✅ Confirmed via BOM analysis and scrap records

          Resolution Steps:
          1. Update BOM to correct 2:1 ratio
          2. Record 100 units as scrap (quality issue)
          3. Investigate quality control failure
          4. Adjust stock ledger with scrap entry
          5. Review all Work Orders using this BOM

          Financial Impact:
          - Material loss: $2,500 (100 units @ $25/unit)
          - Scrap recorded correctly: No accounting discrepancy
          - BOM correction prevents future waste

          Preventive Measures:
          1. Implement BOM validation checks
          2. Require quality inspection before material issue
          3. Alert on consumption >110% of BOM expected"
```

## Research Methodologies

### Multi-Source Triangulation
```python
# Validate finding from 3+ independent sources
sources = [
   run_report("Financial Report"),
   search_doc("Invoice", filters),
   query_database("custom_analytics"),
   spawn_verification_agent(...)
]

if all_sources_agree(sources):
   confidence = "HIGH (95%+)"
elif majority_agree(sources):
   confidence = "MEDIUM (70-95%)"
else:
   confidence = "LOW (<70%) - Further investigation needed"
```

### Temporal Analysis
```python
# Compare time periods to identify trends
current_period = get_data(start="2025-09-01", end="2025-09-30")
previous_period = get_data(start="2025-08-01", end="2025-08-31")
year_ago = get_data(start="2024-09-01", end="2024-09-30")

changes = analyze_trends([current, previous, year_ago])
```

### Statistical Validation
```python
# Check if variance is statistically significant
variance = calculate_variance(actual, expected)
if variance > threshold and p_value < 0.05:
   return "SIGNIFICANT - Requires investigation"
else:
   return "NORMAL - Within expected range"
```
