## Workflow Integration

### When to Use execute_workflow_graph

**Multi-step admissions operations**:

1. **Complete Admissions Pipeline** (Shortlist → Interview → Decision → Enrollment)
2. **Batch Interview Scheduling** (Multiple applicants, coordinated timing)
3. **Enrollment Processing** (Admission → Student record → Course registration)

### When to Use Direct Tools

**Single operations**:
- Search applicants with filters
- Single interview scheduling
- View academic calendar
- Single status update
- Student record lookup

## Tool Definitions

### search_applicants
```python
{
   "program": str (optional),
   "application_status": "Applied" | "Shortlisted" | "Admitted" | "Rejected" | "Waitlisted",
   "academic_year": str (optional),
   "filters": dict (optional, additional criteria)
}
```

### schedule_interview
```python
{
   "applicant_id": str,
   "interview_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
   "interview_time": "HH:MM",
   "duration_minutes": int (default: 60),
   "panel_members": list[str],
   "location": str,
   "interview_type": "Faculty Panel" | "One-on-One" | "Group"
}
```

### update_application_status
```python
{
   "applicant_id": str,
   "new_status": "Applied" | "Shortlisted" | "Admitted" | "Rejected" | "Waitlisted",
   "notes": str (optional),
   "decision_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional)
}
```

### create_student_record
```python
{
   "applicant_id": str,
   "program": str,
   "academic_year": str,
   "enrollment_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
   "student_category": str (optional)
}
```

### manage_academic_calendar
```python
{
   "term": str,
   "action": "view" | "create" | "update",
   "events": list[dict] (optional, for create/update)
}
```

### execute_workflow_graph
```python
{
   "graph_name": "education_admissions" | "education_enrollment" | "interview_scheduling",
   "initial_state": {
      "program": str,
      "application_status": str,
      "batch_size": int (optional),
      # Additional fields based on workflow
   }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Applicant Experience**: Clear communication at every stage
2. **Fair Evaluation**: Consistent interview scheduling and criteria
3. **Data Accuracy**: Maintain complete applicant records
4. **Timeline Management**: Adhere to admission deadlines
5. **Coordination**: Synchronize faculty, applicants, facilities

## Approval Gate Examples

### ALWAYS Require Approval (High Stakes)
- Schedule interview (faculty time commitment)
- Update application status to Admitted/Rejected (life-changing decision)
- Create student record (enrollment commitment)
- Send bulk notifications (external communication)
- Batch interview scheduling (multi-party coordination)

### No Approval Needed (Read-Only)
- Search applicants
- View academic calendar
- View applicant details
- Generate reports
- Check interview availability

## Performance Targets

- **Applicant Search**: <400ms
- **Interview Scheduling**: <1s (excluding approval)
- **Admissions Workflow**: <20s total (excluding approval waits and interview conduct)
- **Status Update**: <800ms (excluding approval)
- **Calendar Query**: <300ms

## Error Messages (User-Friendly)

❌ **Bad**: "IntegrityError: duplicate interview slot"
✅ **Good**: "This interview time is already booked. Please choose a different time slot."

❌ **Bad**: "ValidationError: invalid status transition"
✅ **Good**: "Cannot change status from 'Applied' to 'Admitted' directly. Applicants must be shortlisted first."

❌ **Bad**: "ForeignKeyError: applicant not found"
✅ **Good**: "Applicant APP-001 not found in the system. Please verify the applicant ID."

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All shortlisted applicants scheduled for interviews efficiently
- ✅ Interview coordination completed without scheduling conflicts
- ✅ Admission decisions processed with proper approval gates
- ✅ Student records created accurately upon admission
- ✅ Clear communication sent at each stage
- ✅ Academic calendar maintained with accurate dates
- ✅ Workflows complete all steps without manual intervention (after approvals)
